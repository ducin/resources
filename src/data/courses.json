It will also provide a basic overview of the mechanics of a React app like tree reconciliation and the use of JSX. There's also a brief comparison with alternative libraries and frameworks included. The next module teaches you how to set up a development environment efficiently. You will see create-react-app in action and the setup of Visual Studio Code and Chrome developer tools is covered. Following this, you will cover the structure of an app like the folders that are typically used, the JavaScript entry point and the use of ES2015 modules. You'll also see how the top-level component works and how to place components in folders. Next, you'll touch on components. The difference between function and class components is covered as well as state and props in a component. Also expect explanations on lifecycle methods, error boundaries and ways to compose components. The fifth module is a collection of additional tips to enhance your React experience. Type checking with prop-types is covered as well as separating UI from state, React Router, Flux & Redux and unit testing with Jest. After watching this compact course you are ready to create React apps!",

Spark's general abstraction means it can expand beyond simple batch processing, making it capable of such things as blazing-fast, iterative algorithms and exactly once streaming semantics. In this course, you'll learn Spark from the ground up, starting with its history before creating a Wikipedia analysis application as one of the means for learning a wide scope of its core API. That core knowledge will make it easier to look into Spark's other libraries, such as the streaming and SQL APIs. Finally, you'll learn how to avoid a few commonly encountered rough edges of Spark.

You'll learn how to get going with React Native with minimum development setup as we'll be using Exponent to help us get going very quickly. After building most of the app through Exponent, we'll move into a full-blown environment where you'll learn how to do platform targeting: building special features specifically for a specific platform while trying to achieve as much code reuse as possible. We also introduce Redux to the mix to help us encapsulate our state management in a very elegant manner. This course (and React Native) relies heavily on JavaScript 2015 features!",

To implement these groups of things in C#, we use collections. And to get the most from collections, we need to leverage generics. This course covers how, when, why, and best practices for using C# collections and generics, including arrays, generic interfaces, LINQ, delegates, and Lambda expressions.",

It’s designed to help you learn how software experts keep their architecture clean using a modern approach to software architecture called Clean Architecture, and covers things like domain-centric architecture, application layers, CQRS (Command-Query Responsibility Separation), event sourcing, functional cohesion, bounded contexts, and more. In addition, you'll use these practices to replace the outdated three-layer database-centric architecture that has been used for decades. Most important though, you'll see how these practices, when combined, create an architecture that is simple, understandable, flexible, testable, and maintainable. When you’re done, you’ll have the skills necessary to understand and implement these clean architecture practices on your own software projects. As an introductory course, there are no prerequisites for this course. However, having basic experience with at least one C like programming language, and basic knowledge of software architecture will be beneficial. I look forward to working with you on Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices, and Principles, here at Pluralsight.",

First, you'll discover how to remove jQuery. Next, you'll explore how to implement the feature as a native web component. Finally, you'll cover how to refactor the code to use Polymer.js. By the end of this course, you’ll be able to build native Web Components and Polymer.js components to best suit the needs of your application.",

Initially the images on Docker Hub suffice, but at some point, as you begin to build your own images, you'll outgrow storing them on Docker Hub for a variety of reasons. In this course, Implementing a Self-hosted Docker Registry, we will dissect deploying your own registry in the following scenarios. First, you will learn to take total control of a registry, perhaps as a matter of compliance, and learn to distribute sensitive images privately. Next, you will see how to co-locate a registry for performance reasons, to save bandwidth, or to mirror Docker Hub images to a local registry cache. Then, you will explore the internal workings of a registry and gain flexibility in securing your registry. Finally, you will be able to standardize application packaging and distribution within your organization using Docker images, to reap the same benefits that Docker Hub brought to open-source public applications. By the end of this course, you'll be well prepared to deploy your own self-hosted registry.",

    "Description": "In Practical TypeScript Migration, Steve Ognibene converts a web application that uses popular libraries like jQuery and Knockout to TypeScript. The example app is entirely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so this course is equally applicable to users of any server-side framework. Steve recommends migration techniques that work well, and highlights some things to avoid. He also makes sure to cover related subjects like source control and preparing your team. Once the application is converted over, Steve demonstrates the code refactoring capabilities that TypeScript enables, and then assembles a TypeScript build script using Grunt and other Node.js tools. After watching this course, you will be well prepared to migrate your existing JavaScript code to TypeScript.",

    "Description": "Python Fundamentals gets you started with Python, a dynamic language popular for web development, big data, science, and scripting. What’s so great about Python? Python is powerful. The Python language is expressive and productive, it comes with a great standard library, and it’s the center of a huge universe of wonderful third-party libraries. With Python you can build everything from simple scripts to complex applications, you can do it quickly, and you can do it with fewer lines of code than you might think possible. But for many people those reasons take back-seat to something more important: Python is fun! Python’s readable style, quick edit-and-run development cycle, and “batteries included” philosophy mean that you can sit down and enjoy writing code rather than fighting compilers and thorny syntax. As your experiments become prototypes and your prototypes become products, Python makes the experience of writing software not just easier but truly enjoyable. In the words of Randall Munroe, \"Come join us! Programming is fun again!\"",

In this course, Thinking Functionally in Scala, you will learn how to utilize the power of Scala's functional support, which is often hiding in plain sight. First, you will learn fundamental concepts such as the differences between statements and expressions. Next, you will start to grasp the full implications of first class functions. Finally, you will use higher order methods on collections to create chains of functional composition. When you're finished with this course, you will write clean, idiomatic Scala code that conforms to the functional paradigm, enabling you to harness the power of distributed computing to work with large datasets.",

It also supports strongly-typed code to ensure inappropriate values aren't assigned to variables in an application. This course will walk you through the key concepts and features that you need to know to get started with TypeScript, and use it to build enterprise scale JavaScript applications.

In this course, UX-driven Software Design, you'll learn a new way to design software. First, you'll discover the evidence of what makes software development an unpredictable science. Next, you'll explore how to turn requirements into visual artifacts for customers. Then, you'll cover abstract visual artifacts to input and view models. Finally, you'll learn how to use those models rather than domain and data to drive design and development. By the end of this course, you'll be familiar with a top-down methodology for building most cost-effective software.",
