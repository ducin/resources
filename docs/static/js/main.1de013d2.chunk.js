Next, you'll explore how to use currying and partial application to produce more reusable code and how to create new functions by composing other functions. Finally you'll learn how to control the flow of the application using only functions. When you're finished with this course, you'll have the skills to write JavaScript code in a functional style that will help you produce code that is easier to maintain, to reuse and to test.",DurationInMilliseconds:7707e3,HasTranscript:1,AuthorsFullnames:"Thiago Temple",ImageUrl:"https://img.pluralsight.com/course-images/javascript-ramda-functional-v1.jpg",DefaultImageUrl:"https://s.pluralsight.com/mobile/software-development/beginner.jpg",IsStale:null,UrlSlug:"javascript-ramda-functional"}]},299:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.r(t);var i=a(0),o=a.n(i),n=a(12),r=a.n(n),s=(a(135),a(64)),l=a.n(s),u=a(35),c=a(6),d=function(e){var t=e.value;return new Date(t).toLocaleDateString()},p=function(e){return o.a.createElement(c.b,Object.assign({formatterComponent:d},e))},h=function(e){var t=e.value/1e3,a=Math.floor(t/3600),i=Math.floor((t-3600*a)/60);return"".concat(a,"h ").concat(i,"m")},g=function(e){return o.a.createElement(c.b,Object.assign({formatterComponent:h},e))},m=function(e){var t,a=e.value;return o.a.createElement("a",{href:(t=a,"https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/".concat(t))},a)},f=function(e){return o.a.createElement(c.b,Object.assign({formatterComponent:m},e))},w=(a(296),a(298)),y=[{name:"Title",title:"title"},{name:"AuthorsFullnames",title:"author"},{name:"DurationInMilliseconds",title:"duration"},{name:"ReleaseDate",title:"released"},{name:"UpdatedDate",title:"updated"},{name:"UrlSlug",title:"link"}],v=[{columnName:"Title",width:300},{columnName:"AuthorsFullnames",width:180},{columnName:"DurationInMilliseconds",width:100},{columnName:"ReleaseDate",width:100},{columnName:"UpdatedDate",width:100},{columnName:"UrlSlug",width:160}],b=function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Resources"),o.a.createElement(l.a,null,o.a.createElement(u.a,{rows:w,columns:y},o.a.createElement(c.d,{defaultFilters:[]}),o.a.createElement(c.g,null),o.a.createElement(p,{for:["ReleaseDate","UpdatedDate"]}),o.a.createElement(f,{for:["UrlSlug"]}),o.a.createElement(g,{for:["DurationInMilliseconds"]}),o.a.createElement(c.k,{defaultSorting:[{columnName:"Title",direction:"asc"}]}),o.a.createElement(c.h,null),o.a.createElement(u.b,null),o.a.createElement(u.c,{defaultColumnWidths:v}),o.a.createElement(u.e,{showSortingControls:!0}),o.a.createElement(u.d,null))))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(b,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}},[[130,2,1]]]);
